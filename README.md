My FMOD Studio scripts: https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.00/studio/scripting-terminal-reference.html

* **Build banks for event** (F8): Rebuild only the FMOD banks that the current event is in. Useful when iterating on a single event in a large FMOD project.
* **Random pitch and volume modulation** (Ctrl + Alt + P/O/V/C): Adds/removes or increases/decreases random pitch/volume modulation for the current instrument. I do this frequently.
